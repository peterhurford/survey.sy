# Survey.sy: A Syberia engine for doing survey research in R <a href="https://travis-ci.org/peterhurford/survey.sy"><img src="https://img.shields.io/travis/peterhurford/survey.sy.svg"></a>

Right now this just contains the analyze stage, which displays whatever analysis you run.

This also loads [the surveytools2 package](https://github.com/peterhurford/surveytools2) and [dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr) for survey analysis.

Analyze steps can be specified as a list. Alternatively, they can be specified as a list of lists, with the first list giving metadata on where to write out analyze data to and the second list giving the analysis steps.

Demo code coming soon.
