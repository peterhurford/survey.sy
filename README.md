# Survey.sy: A Syberia engine for doing survey research in R

Right now this just contains the analyze stage, which displays whatever analysis you run.

This also loads [the surveytools2 package](https://github.com/peterhurford/surveytools2) and [dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr) for survey analysis. 

More coming soon.
